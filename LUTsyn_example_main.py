# LUTsyn_example_main.py
# Code by Duy-Tan Jonathan Pham (duytanph@usc.edu)
# July 8, 2021

# This file is a Python script for demonstrating the LUTsyn synapse models described in
# (Pham, 2021). This file executes multiple NEURON simulations that compare the LUTsyn
# model to other synapse models and plots the results. Both AMPA and NMDA cases are
# simulated. This script has been tested using Python (v3.5) and NEURON (v7.6.7).
#
# NOTE: Please be sure to run 'nrnivmodl' in terminal/command prompt in your working
# directory that contains the .mod files before running this script.
